# print_form
Copies input (and textarea) field values to a new web page along with the time, date and url. 
This can be useful during form testing when trying to keep a record of the values entered before submission. 
Hidden form fields can be omitted from the output:  

Omit hidden fields: `print_inputs(false)`

Include hidden fields: `print_inputs(true)`
